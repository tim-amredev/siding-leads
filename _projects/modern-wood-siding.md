This striking modern home in Riverside showcases the natural beauty of Western Red Cedar siding. The architect and homeowners wanted a warm, natural exterior that would contrast with the home's concrete and glass elements while aging beautifully over time.

## Project Details

For this new construction project, we installed clear grade Western Red Cedar in a horizontal tongue and groove pattern. The siding was pre-finished with a semi-transparent stain that enhances the natural grain and color of the cedar while providing UV protection.

The installation pattern was carefully planned to create a seamless flow around the entire structure, with special attention to the alignment of boards at corners and around the numerous large windows that characterize this modern design.

## Challenges and Solutions

Modern architectural designs often present unique installation challenges. This home featured several cantilevered sections and deep overhangs that required precise cutting and fitting of the cedar siding.

The integration of the wood siding with concrete walls and large expanses of glass demanded meticulous planning and execution. Our team worked closely with the architect to ensure that all material transitions were clean and aesthetically pleasing.

## Results

The completed project beautifully showcases how natural wood siding can enhance contemporary architecture. The warm tones and organic texture of the cedar create a perfect balance with the home's sleek, modern lines and industrial elements.

The installation took 14 days to complete, with our team taking extra time to ensure that every board was perfectly aligned and properly sealed. The homeowners were thrilled with the result, which exceeded their expectations for both beauty and craftsmanship.

As the cedar ages, it will develop a distinguished silver-gray patina that will continue to enhance the home's modern aesthetic for decades to come.
