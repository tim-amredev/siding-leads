This charming Craftsman bungalow in Springfield received a historically appropriate exterior renovation using premium fiber cement siding. The homeowners wanted to restore their 1920s home to its original beauty while using modern, durable materials.

## Project Details

The existing vinyl siding, which had been installed in the 1980s, was detracting from the home's authentic Craftsman character. After a detailed consultation, the homeowners selected James Hardie fiber cement siding in a combination of lap siding for the main walls and decorative shingles for the gables, a common feature in Craftsman architecture.

The color palette was carefully chosen to reflect the historic "earthy" tones typical of the Craftsman era, with a warm sage green for the main siding and cream for the trim.

## Challenges and Solutions

Restoring a historic home while using modern materials presents unique challenges. Our team paid special attention to maintaining authentic Craftsman details, including the exposed rafter tails and decorative brackets under the eaves.

The project required removing multiple layers of old siding, revealing some of the original wood clapboard underneath. Where possible, we preserved and restored these historic elements before installing the new fiber cement siding.

## Results

The transformation returned this Craftsman bungalow to its original glory while providing the durability and low maintenance of modern fiber cement siding. The homeowners were delighted with how the project honored their home's architectural heritage while providing modern performance.

The project took 10 days to complete due to the careful attention to historic details and the extra preparation required. The result is a stunning example of how modern materials can be used to restore and preserve historic homes for generations to come.
